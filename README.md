# GuitarGuitar
Do you have the GUTS

Welcome to the GuitarGuitar "Guitar Wizard" Wiki! (bit of a mouthful)

We have used a combination of React.js for the frontend with Django for the backend, utilising the Django REST framework in order to have the two communicate.

We then hosted the application through the use of AWS and this can be accessed at:

Hope you enjoy using our prototype! :)
